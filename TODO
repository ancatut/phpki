TO DO, IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER:

Add CA certificate renewal to sysadmin script (ca/admin/index.php)

Add paging features to Certificate Management Control Panel instead of
having all certificates listed on a single page. This is not really
very necessary unless one will be issuing hundreds of certificates.  Even
with 200 certificates, the control panel display is very manageable.

Use a relational database such as MySQL to maintain the certificate database
instead using the built-in OpenSSL CA feature.  This will only be necessary
if it turns out that the built in OpenSSL CA doesn't perform well.

More documentation and help files.

Support multi-homed server certificates


ANCA'S TODO:

Figure out why gpvar() doesn't initialize variables as it should (at least with empty string).

Replace regex search function eregi() by preg_match() and adjust regex patterns accordingly.

Remove repopulation of password field after error for security.

Reintroduce SSL mode for accessing the page. 

Implement a better password storage solution (check apache's current method).
