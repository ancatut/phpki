TO DO, IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER:

Add CA certificate renewal to sysadmin script (ca/admin/index.php)

Add paging features to Certificate Management Control Panel instead of
having all certificates listed on a single page. This is not really
very necessary unless one will be issuing hundreds of certificates.  Even
with 200 certificates, the control panel display is very manageable.

Use a relational database such as MySQL to maintain the certificate database
instead using the built-in OpenSSL CA feature.  This will only be necessary
if it turns out that the built in OpenSSL CA doesn't perform well.

Support multi-homed server certificates
