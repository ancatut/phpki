<p>The personal e-mail certificate files created by PHPki contain an encrypted
copy of your private key. When your certficate was created, a password was
given to PHPki to encrypt the private key.  The same password is used to
decrypt your private key and install the certificate.  Do not forget or lose 
this password as it cannot be recovered under any circumstance.
Select the <cite>Enable strong private key protection</cite> option if you
would like Windows to add an additional layer of password protection to use 
your certificate.  This is not necessary, and will not be covered further here.
There is no need to select the <cite>Mark the private key as exportable</cite> 
option.  Enter your certificate password and click the <cite>Next</cite> button
in the <cite>Password Protection for Private Keys</cite> window.

<p>Click the <cite>Finish</cite> button in the <cite>Complete the Certificate..</cite> window.

<p>Windows confirms the root certificate was successfully imported.<br>
