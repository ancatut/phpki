<center><h1>PKI and E-mail Encryption - A Brief Explanation</h2></center>

PKI stands for <cite>Public Key Infrastructure</cite>. PKI is Information 
Technology infrastructure that enables users of a basically unsecure public 
network (such as the Internet) to securely and privately exchange data through 
the use of a <a href=glossary.html#KEYS target=glossary>public and a private 
cryptographic key pair</a> that is obtained and shared through a 
<a href=glossary.html#CA target=glossary>trusted Authority</a>.

<p>
Public and private keys are like two halves of a single key.  PKI encryption
algorithms are designed such that a public key is used to encrypt or
"lock" a message, and only the complementary private key can "unlock" that
message.
Think of a bank vault or safe that can only be unlocked by two individuals 
using two different but complementary keys. Neither of those keys can be used
by itself to unlock the vault.

<p>
In practice, individuals wishing to exchange encrypted e-mail
will agree to mutually trust one or more <a href=glossary.html#CA target=glossary>
Certificate Authorities(CA)</a> by downloading and installing each trusted Authority's 
<a href=glossary.html#ROOT-CERT target=glossary>root certificate</a> on their computers.
They will each obtain their own personal 
<a href=glossary.html#CERTIFICATE target=glossary>digital certificate</a>
from a trusted Certificate Authority, and install them on their
respective computers.
Because they mutually trust the Certificate Authorities, they trust each other's
digital certificates.  More specifically, they trust the 
<a href=glossary.html#KEYS target=glossary>public keys</a> contained within
their personal digital certificates which have been 
<a href=glossary.html#SIGNATURE target=glossary>digitally signed</a> by a
trusted Certificate Authority.
They will then exchange their trusted public keys by sending each other 
digitally signed e-mail messages.  Once each party has the other's public key,
they may exchange trusted and encrypted messsages.  

<p>
Public key exchange and encryption is like exchanging notarized documents.
One trusts a notarized document because a trusted third party, the Notary 
Public, has signed it.  The Certificate Authority is the Notary Public, and
the public keys are the documents.

<p>
Remember, having a personal digital certificate alone does <strong>not</strong> 
give one the ability to send encrypted e-mail to others, but only allows the 
<strong>receipt</strong> of encrypted e-mail.  PKI is a cooperative encryption
standard.  Both parties who are exchanging encrypted messages must have
personal digital certificates, they must trust the Certificate Authority 
which issued the other persons certificate, and they must exchange
public keys with each other, as described above.

<p>
The process of installing certificates and exchanging public keys is dependent
upon the e-mail application one uses, and is beyond the scope of this document.
