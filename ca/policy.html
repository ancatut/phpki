<h2 align=center>Certificate Authority Agreement</h2>
<h3 align=center>Policy and Practices</h3>

<br><br>
<p>This is a statement of practices by this Digital Certificate Authority.  
Your use of this Certificate Authority constitutes your and/or your agency's 
understanding and full acceptance of these practices and all associated risks.
<strong>Please have an authorized person at your agency sign this document and fax it to 000-000-0000</strong>

<p>This document may not be all encompassing, and we reserve the right to modify it at any time. 

<ul>
<li> The sole role of this Certificate Authority is
to provide and maintain a password protected software application for the easy
and instant creation and management of standard x.509 personal digital
certificates for e-mail encryption. We assume no responsibility for
verifying the identity of any persons other than that of the limited number of
authorized users of the software.
We accept no liability for damages resulting from the use, misuse,
or compromise of the software application or its host server.

<p><li>As an authorized user of the software, you are in effect <strong>THE</strong> Certificate Authority for your
agency. As such, you are solely
responsible for authenticating the identity of the persons for whom you obtain
certificates. We accept no
responsibility or liability for non-repudiation in any digital certificate
created by this software. You agree that
password protection to the application by authorized certificate managers,
and personal identity management by
those managers is sufficient to create a chain of trust for non-repudiation
in all digital certificates created using the software.

<p><li>No more than two(2)
users at your agency should have access to your agency's Certificate Authority
password. We should be notified
immediately, via e-mail, when the employment of any
authorized user at your agency is terminated so that a new password can be
issued.

<p><li>This Certificate
Authority software application is accessed via the Internet using standard SSL
or Secure Server encryption mechanisms.
Although steps have been taken to protect the security and availability
of the host server and application, its exposure to the Internet as well as any
presently unknown security flaws could lead to potential compromise of the
software and your certificates.

<p><li>No promise is made as
to the availability of the software in the event of hardware, software, or
telecommunications failure or maintenance. 
No advanced notice will be given when the software must be temporarily
taken off line for service.

<p><li>In order to provide
software which can easily create &quot;instant&quot; certificates it is
necessary to store all private keys on the host server.  As such, all private keys are potentially exposed
to the Internet and suffer some risk of unauthorized access. However, since all private keys <strong>ARE
ENCRYPTED</strong> using a password provided by you, they are unlikely to be usable by
any intruder.

<p><li>A publicly accessible
web page is provided for interested Internet users to download the Certificate
Authority root certificate, certificate revocation list, and search for the
e-mail addresses and public certificates of users. So as to avoid e-mail address scraping by spammers, no static
content with users' e-mail addresses is available.
